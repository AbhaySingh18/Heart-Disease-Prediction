# Heart-Disease-Prediction
We have a binary classification problem (a sample can only be one of the two things) with us. In this problem to identify whether or not an individual is having a heart disease or not we will be using number of different features (pieces of information) i.e. clinical data/parameters about a patient, example age, chest pain type, fasting blood sugar, etc.
